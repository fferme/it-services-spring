This thesis presents the development of a web application using the Spring Boot framework, aimed at facilitating the management of people, service orders, and service order items in a business environment. The application is built following the CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) paradigm, offering basic operations for creating, reading, updating, and deleting data.

The developed system provides an intuitive and user-friendly interface, allowing the administrator user to perform various operations efficiently and organized. Through the integration of Spring Boot with other technologies, such as Spring Data JPA for data persistence, MySQL database for storing records, and Angular framework for rendering web pages, it was possible to create a robust and high-performance application.

The developed application can be adapted and customized according to the specific needs of different types of businesses, representing a versatile and scalable tool for various companies in the technology industry.\\
